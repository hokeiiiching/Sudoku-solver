Terminology

A Sudoku (i.e. the puzzle) is a partially completed grid. A grid has 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 boxes, each having 9 cells, for a total of 81 cells. The initially defined values are called "clues" or "givens". An ordinary Sudoku has only one solution. Rows, columns and boxes can be collectively referred to as groups, of which the grid has 27 .The One Rule : "Each digit appears once in each group."
Mathematically, Sudoku is a NP-complete problem. There is no known fast polynomial algorithm for solving the puzzle.


Overall Goals
1) Create a Sudoku Game in CLI
2) Code algorithm that solves the Sudoku
